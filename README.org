* Ido Grid Mode

  This is an enhancement to ido mode which displays the ido prospects in a grid in the minibuffer. I find this makes them easier to read. It can also amend ido's key-bindings so that you can navigate around the grid, rather than scrolling all the completions. I find this also makes it easier to read.

  Here are some pictures:

  [[./pictures/3.png]]

  In these you can see whats going on - the selected item is highlighted in orange, matching parts of items are underlined, and the top line contains a string like [x/y] (z not shown), meaning that there are x items matching your input from y total, and that z are not visible on the screen, but can be scrolled to if you move down enough.

* Installation

  It is a single-file emacs package, so you can use =M-x package-install-file= on it. To switch it on, invoke =(ido-grid-mode 1)=. To switch it off, invoke =(ido-grid-mode -1)=

* Configuration

  Most things are configurable through =M-x customize-group ido-grid-mode=. The important things are =ido-grid-mode-max-rows= and =ido-grid-mode-min-rows=, which determine the size of the thing, and perhaps =ido-grid-mode-order=.

** Size and formatting

   The grid is laid out to fit into the minibuffer's available width, assuming a fixed-width font. Layout is either done left-right then top-bottom or top-bottom then left-right, depending on whether =ido-grid-mode-order= is =rows= or =columns=. I prefer =columns=, which is similar to what zsh does.

   No more than =ido-grid-mode-max-rows= rows should be produced. If the layout can be achieved with fewer rows, then fewer rows will appear, limited by =ido-grid-mode-min-rows=. By default these are the same, which keeps the minibuffer a constant height. If you want the minibuffer to grow and shrink appropriately reduce the min rows.

   If you want the minibuffer to typically be small, but display a large grid on demand, you can use =ido-grid-mode-start-collapsed=. This will limit it to a single row until you press =<tab>=, so long as there are things which would be offscreen. I find this a good setting, as it means that things don't move around on the screen until you want them to.

*** Making a vertical list sometimes

    If you want a particular bit of code to use a vertical list (or some other known layout) you can =let= the appropriate variables around it.

    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
      (let ((ido-grid-mode-max-columns 1)
            (ido-grid-mode-max-rows 30))
        (completing-read ...))
    #+END_SRC

    You might want to do this in an advice, e.g.:

    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
      ;; make projectile-find-file vertical list

      (defun ido-vertical-please (o &rest args)
        (let ((ido-grid-mode-max-columns 1)
              (ido-grid-mode-max-rows 15) ;; bigger list than usual
              (ido-grid-mode-min-rows 1) ;; let it shrink
              (ido-grid-mode-start-collapsed nil) ;; pop up tall at the start
              ;; why not have a different prefix as well?
              (ido-grid-mode-prefix ":: "))
          (apply o args)))

      (advice-add 'projectile-find-file :around #'ido-vertical-please)
    #+END_SRC

** Keys

   By default, =ido-grid-mode= will mangle your key-bindings for =<up>=, =<down>=, =<left>=, =<right>=, =<tab>=, =<backtab>=, =C-n= and =C-p= when in the minibuffer. These are bound to move around the grid and page up / down when there are many items. You can change this by customizing =ido-grid-mode-keys=; set it to =nil= to leave the keys alone. The movement commands are =igm-<up,down,left,right>=, =igm-previous=, =igm-next=, =igm-previous-page=, and =igm-next-page=.

** Faces

   At the moment, =ido-use-faces= is ignored, and faces are always added. This is partly because you need a face to see the highlighted item. The faces used are:

   - =ido-grid-mode-match=, which is used to highlight matching substrings
   - =ido-first-match=, which is used to highlight the selected prospect
   - =ido-only-match=, which is used when there is only one prospect
   - =ido-subdir=, which is used to colour in directories in ido-find-file
   - =ido-grid-mode-prefix=, which is used for the common prefix string
   - =ido-incomplete-regexp=, which is used when there is an incomplete regexp.

** Top line

   The top line shows some information after point; this is configurable with =ido-grid-mode-first-line=.
